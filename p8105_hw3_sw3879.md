Setting up libraries

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(ggridges)
library(patchwork)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Problem 1

### Loadiing the dataset for Q1

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")

instacart = instacart |> as.tibble() |> janitor::clean_names()
```

    ## Warning: `as.tibble()` was deprecated in tibble 2.0.0.
    ## ℹ Please use `as_tibble()` instead.
    ## ℹ The signature and semantics have changed, see `?as_tibble`.
    ## This warning is displayed once every 8 hours.
    ## Call `lifecycle::last_lifecycle_warnings()` to see where this warning was
    ## generated.

### Describing the dataset

The `instacart` dataset as 1384617 rows and 15 columns. Important
variables include unique identifier of customer, order date, days since
previous order, and specific information about the product purchased.
There are a total of 131209 orders recorded, and 39123 recorded. These
products range from 21 different departments.

### Answering questions

``` r
instacart |> count(aisle) |> arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2

There are 134 aisles, and the most ordered items are from fresh
vegetables and fresh fruits.

Making a plot:

``` r
instacart |> count(aisle) |> filter(n > 10000) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(aisle, -n), y = n)) + geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Number of product ordered by aisle",
       x = "Aisle Name", y = "Number of product ordered") 
```

Making a table of top 3 ordered items from “baking ingredients”, “dog
food care”, “packaged vegetables fruits”:

``` r
instacart |> filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) |> 
  group_by(aisle) |> count(product_name) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |> top_n(n = 3, wt = n) |> 
  rename(times_ordered = n) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  | times_ordered |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|--------------:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          |          9784 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           |          5546 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           |          4966 |

Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week:

``` r
instacart |>
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) |>
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) |>
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow, 
    values_from = mean_hour) |>
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

## Problem 2

Load the dataset

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

Clean data, rename variables, remove unnecessary observations, and
reorder data

``` r
brfss_clean = brfss_smart2010 |> as.tibble() |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  rename(location_abbr = locationabbr) |> 
  rename(location_desc = locationdesc) |> 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") |> 
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", 
                                                "Very good", "Excellent"), 
                           ordered = TRUE)) |> 
  arrange(response)
```

In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about
in 2010?

``` r
result_2002 = brfss_clean |> filter(year == "2002") |> 
  group_by(location_abbr) |> 
  summarize(dictinct_loc_count = n_distinct(location_desc)) |> 
  filter(dictinct_loc_count >= 7)
```

``` r
result_2010 = brfss_clean |> filter(year == "2010") |> 
  group_by(location_abbr) |> 
  summarize(dictinct_loc_count = n_distinct(location_desc)) |> 
  filter(dictinct_loc_count >= 7)
```

In 2002, 6 states were observed at 7 or more locations, they are CT, FL,
MA, NC, NJ, PA

In 2010, 14 states were observed at 7 or more locations, they are CA,
CO, FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TX, WA

Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data_value
across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average
value over time within a state

``` r
brfss_excellent = brfss_clean |> 
  filter(response == "Excellent") |> 
  select(c("year", "location_abbr", "data_value")) |> 
  group_by(year, location_abbr) |> 
  mutate(data_value = mean(data_value)) |> 
  distinct() |> 
  rename(state = location_abbr)
```

``` r
brfss_excellent |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = data_value, group = state, color = as.factor(state))) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Average BRFSS data per state, 2002 - 2010",
       x = "Year", y = "Average BRFSS data", 
       color = "State")
```

    ## Warning: Removed 3 rows containing missing values (`geom_line()`).

TO DO: comment on result

Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
distribution of data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
locations in NY State.

``` r
brfss_ny = brfss_clean |> 
  filter(year %in% c("2006", "2010")) |> 
  filter(location_abbr == "NY") |> 
  select(c("year", "location_abbr", "location_desc","response", "data_value"))
```

``` r
brfss_ny |> ggplot(aes(x = response, y = data_value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of BRFSS data by response in NY",
       x = "Response", y = "BRFSS data") +
  facet_grid(. ~ year)
```

## Problem 3

Load the demographics dataset, recode variable and remove \<21 years old

``` r
demo = read_csv("data/nhanes_covar.csv", skip = 4) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter(age >= 21) |> 
  mutate(sex = case_match(

```

Produce a reader-friendly table for the number of men and women in each
education category, and create a visualization of the age distributions
for men and women in each education category.

``` r
demo |> group_by(education) |> count(sex) |> 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = sex,
    values_from = n
  ) |> 
  rename(female_number = Female, male_number = Male) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

TO DO: comment on the table

Using your tidied dataset, aggregate across minutes to create a total
activity variable for each participant. Plot these total activities
(y-axis) against age (x-axis); your plot should compare men to women and
have separate panels for each education level. Include a trend line or a
smooth to illustrate differences.

``` r
merged_df |> group_by(seqn) |> 
  summarize(aggre_data = sum(as.numeric(accel_data))) |> 
  right_join(demo) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = aggre_data, color = sex)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Total activity by age",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Total activity",
       color = "Sex") +
  facet_wrap(. ~ education)
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(seqn)`
    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'

![](p8105_hw3_sw3879_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png)<!-- -->

TO DO: add comment

Make a three-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time courses for
each education level and use color to indicate sex.

``` r
merged_df |> 
  group_by(time_min, education, sex) |> 
  summarize(data_per_min = mean(as.numeric(accel_data))) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = time_min, y = data_per_min, color = sex)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Total activity by hours in a day",
       x = "Time in min",
       y = "Total activity per min",
       color = "Sex") +
  facet_wrap(. ~ education)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'time_min', 'education'. You can override
    ## using the `.groups` argument.
